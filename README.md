# Personal-Training-Scheduling-System

# About

The project focuses on a personal training scheduling system with three core services: user registration and authentication, scheduling and management of training sessions and facilities, and a notification service for booking confirmations and reminders. The system uses an API gateway and Netflix libraries to ensure efficient service management and integration.

# System Overview:

The system consists of three services:

    User Service: Handles user authentication and authorization. Supports multiple user types with varying privileges.
    Training Scheduling Service: Allows clients to browse and book available training slots. Also manages gym facility details.
    Notification Service: Sends email notifications confirming booked sessions and reminders before the session starts.

# Additional Components:

    API Gateway: Routes requests between services.
    Client Application: Provides a GUI for system access and functionality.
